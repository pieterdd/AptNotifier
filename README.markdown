Description
===========

AptNotifier (pronounced *Appointment Notifier*) is an application that helps you keep track of your calendar by notifying you about upcoming and ongoing events. It is written in C++ and depends on the Qt library. Since Qt is available for all major platforms, AptNotifier works on Windows, Linux and Mac.

For an up-to-date list of the current limitations of AptNotifier, check our [issue tracker](https://github.com/pieterdd/AptNotifier/issues).

Currently we're dealing with a bug that sometimes causes release versions of AptNotifier to crash at startup. We have introduced logging to help us track down the context of this issue. So far we haven't been able to replicate this problem in debug versions, so we're left in the dark for now.
